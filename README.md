# Aesthepics

A photo-sharing social media web app where users can create an account, post pictures, customize their profiles, add friends, like posts and comment on them.

This is part of a full stack (MERN) project of my own, using React for its front end, Node and Express for its backend and MongoDB as its database.

In addition to React, the following libraries were used for the front end design:  Axios, Chakra UI, Framer Motion, React Icons, React Hook Form, React Router, React Cookie, React Infinite Scroll Component.
